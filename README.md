# Introduction-to-XAMPP-server
Here you will know about the XAMPP server and installation of the server and running process.
To get know about the installation of the XAMPP server you should have about IP address and Networking over internet atleast a few about them.To install XAMPP server visit - www.apachefriends.org and then download that for your architecture and then install it and get it ready for the setup.

<!- you should have learnt about the IP networking or HTML, PHP and server-client operations-->

Later, after installation start the control panel of the XAMPP server and start apache server. Check by typing "localhost" in your default browser. If it opens a XAMPP default page then your server is ready for hosting the files on your wifi network or in LAN network. Now open your XAMPP file in your default drive [C:/XAMPP] and go to htdocs and then create a HTML file and then again type "localhost" in your default browser, you need to see your HTML file in your browser. Just create a HTML file to check whether the XAMPP server's condition is good or not. Later we will discuss about the ngrok and file-server tunneling from another region.
